A small python script to move your mouse, press the shift key, and keep your PC awake when you're away

Uses command line arguments to set the number of minutes between movements and requires Python3 or higher.

Default timer is 60 seconds, but can be set which whatever amount you want.

# Dependencies
This software uses PyAutoGui https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui as the driver behind the movement.
